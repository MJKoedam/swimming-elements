Add swimming animation elements to your Elementor-powered website easily with this plugin.

## Description

Swimming Elements is a plugin that allows you to add animated swimming elements to your Elementor-designed pages.
You can customize the animation speed and direction of the swimming-movement.
Note: At this moment, the plugin only gives a static movement for the element and does not actually make the element swim throughout the page.

## Installation

1. Upload the `swimming-elements` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Drag the "Swimming Element" widget into your Elementor layout.
4. Customize the widget settings to configure the swimming animation as desired.
5. Save your changes and preview your Elementor-designed page with the swimming animation.
